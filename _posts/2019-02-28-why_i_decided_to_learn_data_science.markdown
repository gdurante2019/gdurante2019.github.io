## The Global Scale and the Personal Perspective

By Gina Durante

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by how things work.  When I was 6 or 7 years old, for example, I wondered how a camera worked, and drew some schematics in which I imagined that different-colored powders were pushed across film in the camera to create the image.  (Okay, so there were a few gaps in my understanding…how would the powder colors “know” where to deposit on the film?…but it was cool to come up with ideas about how something might work.)  In another case, I wondered if it would be possible to build a kind of motorized “pod” that I could drive on the side of the road (or on the sidewalk) to my grandparents’ house, so I would not have to wait for a ride or walk 30+ minutes to get there.  I drew pictures of what it might look like and imagined how it might be powered (and also how to make sure that an 8-year old would not get in trouble for driving it, the way an 8-year old would get in trouble for driving a car!).  

These activities brought together my love of drawing with the joy of problem solving and figuring out how things worked.  When I was in elementary school, I thought I might become an artist.  As I got older, I realized that I had an aptitude for science, and was fascinated by biology, which was my major as an undergraduate.  I have wide-ranging interests, and as I got my master’s degree in environmental studies and later an MBA, I realized that I most enjoyed working on broad, complex problems, and realized that management consulting could be a good fit.  While I enjoy the activities involved in consulting, working in that industry (especially for the bigger and/or name-brand firms) has significant downsides, and so I sought other opportunities to leverage as many of my skills and interests as possible.  However, in this day and age, specialization is the name of the game, and it seemed like few careers outside of consulting would allow me to employ the full range of my interests, creative talents, and analytical skills—until now.  

To me, the field of data science offers numerous opportunities to apply analytical and creative abilities in virtually every field, exploring challenging questions and generating insights that can be used for decision-making and developing action plans.  The burgeoning amount of data being generated in virtually every field creates an imperative for organizations to develop the programming and analytical skills to manage this data efficiently.  Further, data science provides powerful visualization tools for effectively communicate the results of analyses to non-technical audiences.  

One area about which I am passionate is environmental protection and sustainability.  I’ve spent the better part of my career seeking to understand the science and complex interplay of economics, sociology, politics, and psychology that contribute to climate change.  The tools of data science can improve our ability to understand and communicate the risks and effects of climate change in a way that people can readily grasp.  This is crucial in preparing for the most challenging aspects of climate change.  

I’m keenly interested in ways to effectively communicate complex subjects and information in a world that is increasingly saturated with information—and misinformation.  The tools of data science are an important ally in communicating the challenges posed by climate change, and what we as a society can do to address them.  Visually interesting graphs, images, and animations can convey complex information in an intuitive manner and make it easier for even non-technical audiences to better understand causes and effects and make decisions based on this knowledge.

After a couple of years of learning about the field of data science and exploring different programs and courses of study (including self-study using some of the many fantastic online resources), I decided to go with Flatiron's structured full-time program.  I'm excited to be in a structured program with a comprehensive curriculum and a cohort of other online full-time data science students!  Looking forward to the next steps in this journey.
